== FIGGS: Finite Groups in Granular and Unit Synthesis ==

This is the rewriting of the old 'FIGGS': Finite Groups in Granular and Unit Synthesis

Install it with the usual 'python setup.py install'

------
For now, FIGGUS is structured as follows:

1) Sonic Material
class UnitGrain is a sonic grain/event
class Sequence takes a sequence of UnitGrain classes in a specific order

2) Permutations
class Permutation is a permutation with some facilities for displaying notation and alterations
class PermutationPattern is a permutation with some more info, like periodicity

3) Resulting Patterns
class Pattern is where the grains and the permutations entangle and where the synthesis come to life

4) Utils
class Tables (in tables.py) reads tables for lookup from directory tables/
class IOUtils is dedicated to easy pattern and vectors IOs

some more elaborated Finite Group stuff should come soon, probrably via gap.

# USAGE:
import figgus as f

p=f.Pattern() # Pattern uses standard sonic units
p.synthesizeSonicVectors() #  # makes the sonic vector

io=f.IOUtils() # instantiates a IO class
io.recordPattern("som.wav",p) # Make .wav from pattern p please :-)
